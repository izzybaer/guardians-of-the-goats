# Mission Statement Content
\n  
When we first came up with the idea for Guardians of the Goats, our goal was to create a place to connect goat advocates throughout the United States. Since then it has blossomed and bloomed, and now it also a place to find goats in need of care or rescue in specific locations. We want to make it easier for people who care to locate goats in need, and to connect with others near them who also want the same things. All over the world goats are abused, sold for slaughter, discarded, and abandoned because of neurological disorders or physical deformities. Goats are innocent creatures that feel pain, fear, and love. At Guardians of the Goats we care about all goats, and want to provide love and care for all that we can.

About Us  
\n  
We are a group of friends who met through volunteering at several different goat rescues in Washington State over the last few years. Our love for goats brought us to each other, and our passion for protecting and caring for them ignited a spark in our hearts that lit the fire of Guardians of the Goats. Saving one goat makes this entire project worth all of the work we put into it to get it off the ground.
